# Softmax_neural_network

Build up of a neural network by hand and compare its results with tensorflow over MNIST dataset 

## To train the network on your machine, first install all necessary dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Run Python MNIST with Keras
### Currently running with a learning rate = 0.001 and epochs = 5

python MNIST_Multinomial_version/MNIST_keras/MNIST_keras.py

## Run Python MNIST without Keras
### Currently running with a learning rate = 0.001 and epochs = 5

python MNIST_Multinomial_version/MNIST_MultiLogReg.py
